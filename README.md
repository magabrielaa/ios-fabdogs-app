# CUSTOM FEATURE: MAPKIT

For my Custom Feature Project I implemented a **MapViewController** that is linked to my **DetailViewController**.

In the Detail View, I added a button that says _"See the breed's origin"_. When this button is tapped, it opens a Map View.

The Map View displays a pin over the coordinates of the selected breed's origins. It also shows an annotation text for that location. I added a Navigation Title on the top to orient the user as to which breed the map is referring to.

Here's a GIF showing my custom feature:
